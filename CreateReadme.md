# README Generation Process

## Objective

Create a professional README.md that demonstrates advanced programming skills, particularly in TDD, testing patterns, and architecture-through-refactoring. Target audience: potential employers (mostly technical people, less or so recruiters).

## Phase 0: Pre-Analysis Questions

Before starting the analysis, ask the user the following questions one by one to ensure accurate documentation:

1. **Project Context**
   - What was the primary business purpose of this project?
   - Was this a commercial project, personal learning project, or proof-of-concept?
   - What was your specific role in the project? (sole developer, team lead, contributor, etc.)

2. **Technical Focus**
   - Are there specific technical achievements you want to highlight? (e.g., performance optimizations, complex integrations, innovative solutions)
   - What testing approaches were most important in this project? (unit, integration, E2E, TDD, etc.)
   - Were there any significant refactoring efforts or architectural decisions worth noting?

3. **Project Outcome**
   - Is the project currently in production, abandoned, or used as a portfolio piece?
   - What were the main challenges you overcame during development?
   - Are there any specific metrics or achievements to mention? (performance improvements, test coverage, etc.)

4. **Documentation Scope**
   - Should the README focus on the entire project or specific components?
   - Are there any sensitive details that should be omitted?
   - Do you want to emphasize particular skills for specific job applications?

5. **Additional Context**
   - Any interesting stories or learning experiences from this project?
   - Technologies or patterns you were exploring for the first time?
   - Collaboration details if it was a team project?

**Wait for all answers before proceeding to Phase 1.**

## Phase 1: Project Analysis

1. **Explore Project Structure**
   - Analyze the target repository's directory structure
   - Identify main components, APIs, and architectural patterns
   - Note testing approach and implementation details

2. **Extract Key Information**
   - Project purpose and business context
   - Technology stack and frameworks used
   - Testing strategy and coverage
   - Architectural decisions and patterns

## Phase 2: Content Generation

### Section 1: Project Overview

- Write concise project description
- Explain PoC nature and business context professionally
- Highlight TDD approach as key technical achievement
- Emphasize learning and skill demonstration aspects

### Section 2: Testing Patterns Analysis

- Explore all test files in the project
- Identify and document testing patterns used
- Describe testing philosophy and approach
- Reference specific test files as examples
- Focus on testing methodology over technology specifics

### Section 3: Architecture Strengths

- Analyze code structure and design patterns
- Identify architectural strengths and refactoring evidence
- Document clean code principles and design decisions
- Provide specific file references with code snippets
- Emphasize maintainability and scalability considerations

## Phase 3: Enhancement

1. **GitHub Integration**
   - Get git remote URL: `git remote -v`
   - Identify current branch: `git branch --show-current`
   - Convert all file references to clickable GitHub links
   - Format: `[filename](https://github.com/user/repo/blob/branch/path/to/file)`

2. **Content Optimization**
   - Review for clarity and conciseness
   - Ensure professional tone throughout
   - Remove redundant information
   - Strengthen focus on testing and architecture skills
   - Add proper formatting and structure

## Usage Instructions

1. Place this file in the root directory of any repository you want to document
2. Run the process using your AI assistant
3. The assistant will analyze the repository and generate a professional README.md

## Quality Criteria

- Demonstrates advanced testing knowledge
- Shows architectural thinking and refactoring skills
- Professional, recruiter-friendly tone
- Proper GitHub file references
- Clear, well-structured content
- Prefer quality over quantity
- Technology-agnostic approach (focus on skills, not tools)

## Output Format

- Use Markdown with proper headers
- Include code snippets where relevant
- Maintain professional documentation standards
- Ensure all GitHub links are functional
