# Project Contribution Interview and Report

## Background

These is my project contribution report as a software engineer that I will be shaing with my manager. He has a lot of projects, so keep it short, factual and to the point. I need to him to understand what I did in this project and how much value I bring to the company, the team and himself.

## Process

1. Read my git log, filter only my commits (done by Ilyas Landikov) from merged branches from the whole project, analyse not just commit messages but also the code changes.
2. Identify main project advancements, for each use a meaningful heading, sort them by following priorities: features, bugfixes, refactoring & tests, other and confirm them to me, I may have other points to add.
3. Distill the key points and big-picture value.
4. Draft and refine each section with the me.
5. Put everything in a markdown file with filename `{Project name}-YYYY-MM-DD.md`, use title `# Project Contribution - YYYY-MM-DD`, use today's date.

## Style Guidelines

- Encourage rapid, iterative edits and confirmations with the me.
- Be brief and focused. It's fine to have just one main section if that's the project's reality.
- Short and concise. 1-2 paragraphs per section.
- Easy to read and scan, should be readable in under 2 minutes.
- Start new sentences on new lines, so the markdown does not need to wrap.
- Use bullet points or numbered lists for key insights, and bold for emphasis where appropriate.
