## Workshopping Craft Talk: Agentic AI

Today, I had a coaching session for my upcoming "Agentic AI" talk at the Craft Conference.
We focused on the opening of the presentation.

A key surprise was the realization that my initial focus was misaligned with what the talk truly needed to convey.
I discovered I need to pivot to a completely different core message.
Interestingly, an analogy I was using (the "brown M&M" concept) proved *too* effective.
It risked becoming the main takeaway, so I'll need to adjust its prominence.

What went very well was identifying a new, much stronger starting point for the talk.
I need to begin by sharing a story about my experience using agentic AI.
This should be followed by a story of how I translated that experience into a reusable process file.
This narrative arc needs to be established before delving into other topics.

Progress was made in pinpointing this crucial structural change during the session.
Afterwards, I was able to create the initial slides to tell this new opening story.

The main challenge was the emotional aspect of recognizing that a part of the talk I had developed and was attached to wasn't the right fit.
It's a tough but necessary part of the refinement process.
